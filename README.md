# Example of infinite scroll using reagent

The example uses the code from the gist in https://gist.github.com/nberger/b5e316a43ffc3b7d5e084b228bd83899

Run it with `lein figwheel`, open http://localhost:3449 and see how the items load in chunks of 10 items,
until 40 items have been loaded. Seems like magic!
